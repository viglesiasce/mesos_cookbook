Application cookbook for installing the [Apache Mesos][] cluster manager.
Mesos provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed
applications, or frameworks.  This cookbook installs Mesos via packages
provided by [Mesosphere][].

Requirements
------------

- Chef >= 11
- Ruby 1.9.3 or higher

Platform
--------
Tested on

* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Debian Wheezy
* CentOS 6

Supported Mesos Versions
------------------------

This cookbook supports the following Apache Mesos versions:

* 0.23.0
* 0.22.1
* 0.22.0
* 0.21.1
* 0.21.0

We intend to support at most the three latest versions of Apache Mesos including
all patch releases for supported major versions. Ex. 0.21.0 + 0.21.1 etc..

Attributes
----------
In order to keep the README managable and in sync with the attributes, this
cookbook documents attributes inline. The usage instructions and default
values for attributes can be found in the individual attribute files.

Configuring Mesos via attributes
-----------------------------------------
This cookbook introduces a few points of validation to prevent passing Mesos
invalid configuration options.  The file [attributes/mesos_options.rb](attributes/mesos_options.rb)
contains a hash of all valid Mesos configuration options for all Mesos versions
supported by this cookbook.  This cookbook will fail to converge if you try to
use an invalid configuration option as a command line flag attribute under
`[‘mesos’][‘master’][‘flags]` or `[‘mesos’][‘slave’][‘flags]` hashes.

The valid list of Mesos options are available in the Mesos documentation for the
latest options here: http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/configuration/
as well as in this Google Sheets document which keeps track of what configuration
options are available per Mesos version here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IER03xhtOSj9unW5AYIqn-tu-laAHlPSOYhM6xw4QHg/edit#gid=0

## Recipes

### default
The default mesos recipe will run mesos::install.

### install
The install recipe installs the specified version of the mesosphere mesos
RPM or Debian package and installs it.  It’s also configured to stop both
mesos-master and mesos-slave init files so that they don't automatically
start on server restart.

### master
The master recipe runs mesos::install as well as creating several
mesos-master configuration files that are used at startup.  This recipe also
uses the zookeeper attributes and/or exhibitor attributes to configure the
mesos-master using zookeeper.  Lastly it sets the mesos-master init config to
'start' so that mesos-master is started on server restart.

### slave
The slave recipe runs mesos::install as well as creating several
mesos-slave configuration files that are used at startup.  This recipe also
uses the zookeeper attributes and/or exhibitor attributes to configure the
mesos-slave using zookeeper.  Lastly it sets the mesos-slave init config to
'start' so that mesos-slave is started on server restart.

### repo
The repo recipe contains logic for setting up Mesosphere debian and RPM
repositories.

Dependencies
------------

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* [apt][]
* [yum][]
* [java][]
* [chef-sugar][]

The following cookbooks are suggested:

* [exhibitor][] (used for discovering ZooKeeper ensembles via [Netflix Exhibitor][])

Usage
-----

Here is a sample role for configuring a Mesos master in a ZooKeeper backed
production mode.

```YAML
chef_type:           role
default_attributes:
description:
env_run_lists:
json_class:          Chef::Role
name:                mesos_master
override_attributes:
  mesos:
    version: 0.23.0
    master:
      flags:
        cluster: 'mesos-sandbox'
        zk: 'zk://127.0.0.1:2181/mesos'
run_list:
  recipe[mesos::master]
```

Here is a sample role for creating a Mesos slave node with a seperate ZooKeeper
ensemble dynamically discovered via Netflix Exhibitor:
```YAML
chef_type:           role
default_attributes:
description:
env_run_lists:
json_class:          Chef::Role
name:                mesos_slave
override_attributes:
  mesos:
    version: 0.23.0
    slave:
      flags:
        master: 'zk://127.0.0.1:2181/mesos'
run_list:
  recipe[mesos::slave]
```
